Number 13 has a very nicely decorated driveway, plenty of plantlife and a few baskets on the doorstep, but no car. 14 has two hatchbacks, and you can hear talking inside. 15 is not very decorated, and has a sedan outside. 16 has a Ford Focus, and a well-looked after paved driveway. You walk up to number 14 and reach for the doorbell - without warning it opens suddenly, revealing a slightly confused woman . There's a small child behind her, and a middle-aged man at the end of the hallway. [Angela]""Can I help you?""  She asks. [Player]""Sorry to disturb. Just a few questions about anything you might have heard last night?"".  [Angela]""Uh, sure."" The man shepherds the small child back through the hallway. [Player]""Can I take your name?""

You try and make out the number of the house opposite: [Player]""Number 13"". You walk up, knock on the door and wait. There's no answer immediately, but you can see a figure through the frosted glass slowly making their way over. When the door does open, you see an elderly man. [Player]""Sorry to disturb you, sir. We're just checking if the residents of this street heard anything in the early hours of last night."" The man chuckles to himself, breaking out into a cough as he does so. [Peter]""I'm afraid we won't be of much help to you. Margaret and I didn't stay up past eight last night."" [Player]""I see. Can I take your name?"" [Peter]""It's Peter Armstrong.

[Ernie]""Well, not from my house. But I do like to go for walks sometimes, and I was walking around here and I wasn't sure if I heard something like a bang.

You walk to the examination room- the man is on a table looking not particularly alive.",Ask if the fall killed him,Ask for the cause of death,29,30,,,,,,,,
29,"[Kathryn]""Well, actually, that was pretty easily to rule out. You see, it's quite unlikely that he died from the fall because of the pretty large shotgun wound in his back. And we didn't find any signs that he fell.""",Ask for the time of death,31,,,,,,,,,,
