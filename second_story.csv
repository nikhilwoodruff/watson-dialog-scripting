Just before leaving the page you notice that James Stockfield is listed as a member. He looks like the unfriendly student James who identified himself as Robert’s friend so you conclude they must be the same person.

Police find James at the train station and are able to bring him to the station with some difficulty. After a few hours James gives up and provides a complete testimony of the events that occurred. It turns out that Robert had been given some ecstasy by some members of the society and passed out while drinking. A little later the students determined that he had died. Hoping to avoid trouble they decided to dump the body in the river. The police chief tells you that your work is done and that the police will finish the proceedings from here. He praises you for a job well done and leaves you his email saying to message him if he wants any work experience for the summer. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
